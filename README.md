# Constant Time Generation of Free Trees

Combinatorial algorithm on generating unlabeled free trees in constant amortized time and O(n) space

This repository contains a Python implementation of the CAT (Constant Amortized Time) algorithm developed in "Constant time generation of free trees" (1986) by Wright, Richmond, Odlyzko, and McKay. The paper we used is avilable at https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/compsci720s1c/lectures/mjd/treenotes.pdf

**generateFreeTree.py** contains the python code of the CAT algorithm for generating non-isomorphic free trees.
