#Constant Time Generation of Free Trees
Combinatorial algorithm for generating unlabeled free trees in constant amortized time and O(n) space.

This repository contains a Python implementation of the CAT (Constant Amortized Time) algorithm developed in "Constant time generation of free trees" (1986) by R.A. Wright, B. Richmond, A. Odlyzko and B.D. McKay. The paper we used is available at https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/compsci720s1c/lectures/mjd/treenotes.pdf
